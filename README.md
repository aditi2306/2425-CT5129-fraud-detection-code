# Fraud Detection with GAN-Augmented Data

This repository contains experiments on fraud detection using various **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** and classical as well as deep learning models.  
The goal is to handle the **class imbalance problem** in fraud datasets by generating synthetic fraud samples.

## üìå Methodology

The methodology used for this work is shown below:

![Methodology](methodology.png)

1. Preprocess the dataset (real credit card fraud data).  
2. Train different GAN variants (GAN, WGAN, CGAN, CTGAN, VAE-GAN) on minority fraud data.  
3. Generate synthetic fraud samples.  
4. Train classification models (Random Forest, LightGBM, LSTM, RNN, Transformer) on real + synthetic data.  
5. Evaluate using ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, F1-score, Precision, and Recall.
